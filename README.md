# 🐶 Dog Age to Human Years Converter

This simple C++ program calculates a dog's age in **human years**.

## 📖 About

The program asks for:
- Your buddy's **name** 🐾
- Your buddy's **current age in dog years**

Then it uses the following logic to convert dog years into human years:

- The first two years of a dog's life count as **21 human years**.
- Each additional year counts as **4 human years**.

Finally, it prints your buddy's name and their age in human years!
